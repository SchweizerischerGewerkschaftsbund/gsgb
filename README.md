# gsgb
R code mit dem CI des SGB

The gsgb package implements the corporate design of the Swiss Trade Union Confederation (SGB, Schweizerischer Gewerkschaftsbund) in R. The gsgb package provides 
color functions — by defining dedicated colors and color palettes, and commands for changing, viewing, and using them. The functions to define and use palettes are based on 
the package unikn from Hansjörg Neth and Nico Gradwohl, created for the University of Konstanz.
